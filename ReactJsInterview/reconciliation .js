// what is reconciliation  in Reactjs

// This is a simplified example, but it demonstrates the basic process of reconciliation 
// in React. By efficiently updating the UI in response to changes in the application state, 
// React makes it possible to build responsive, dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to the
//  needs of modern web development.
// Finally, React will apply the necessary changes to the DOM to reflect the 
// new state of the application.
