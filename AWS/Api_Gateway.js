//API Gateway

// Amazon API Gateway is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services 
// (AWS) that allows you to create, publish, manage, and secure APIs 
// (Application Programming Interfaces) for your applications.

// some key features and concepts related to Amazon API Gateway

// API Creation: 
// With API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs or WebSocket 
// APIs. RESTful APIs are commonly used for HTTP-based communication, while
// WebSocket APIs enable real-time bidirectional communication over WebSocket 
// connections.



// API Deployment:
// Once you've defined your API, you can deploy it to different
// stages (e.g., development, testing, production) to make it accessible to 
// users. Each stage corresponds to a specific version of your API.

// Integration with Backend Services: You can configure your API methods to 
// integrate with various backend services, such as AWS Lambda functions, 
// AWS Step Functions, HTTP endpoints, or AWS services like DynamoDB or S3.
