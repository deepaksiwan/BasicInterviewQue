The United States Department of Commerce 
and its Indian counterpart have recently 
concluded a memorandum of understanding in
 March 2023 to ensure that subsidies by each
  country do not come in the way of India’s semiconductor 
  dreams, as espoused by the much publicised semiconductor
   policy launched in December 2021. The U.S. Department of State has also
    engaged with India to beef up sector-specific export control laws in the
     semiconductor space — which India has agreed to, as in recent media reports.
